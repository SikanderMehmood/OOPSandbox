Java Map does not allow duplicate keys
duplicate values are allowed as well null values (TreeMAP cannot have a null key)

Fail fast iterators throw exception if the collection is modified when iterating over it.
Fail safe does not throw exception if collection is modified when iterating over

Difference HashMap - HashTable

HashMap is not thread safe , not synchronized.                     HashTable is synchronized. Thread safe
HashMap allow one null key and multiple null values                HashTable does not allow null key and value.

            HashMap is preffered is you don't need multithreading.


            Why HashTable can't have null values?
            To store and retrieve values from HashTable the objects used as keys must implement hashCode and equals() method , since null is not an
            object it cannot implement these methods so can't have null values in HashTable


HashMap does not call hashcode function when null key is passed and it is handled as special case.
