Database.JPA (Java-Persistence-Api)
   It's a specification for accessing, persisting and managing data between java objects

   Database.JPA is just a specification and you need some tool to implement it.

Spring Data Jpa is an abstraction on top of Database.JPA and Hibernate.
Spring data jpa adds another layer of abstraction over your jpa implementation provider.
