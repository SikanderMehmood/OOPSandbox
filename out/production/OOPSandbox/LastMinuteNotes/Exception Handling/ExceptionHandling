Custom Exception :
                 public class WrongFileNameException extends Exception {
                     public WrongFileNameException(String errorMessage) {
                     super(errorMessage);
                     }
                 }


Checked Exception
                 The classes that directly inherit the Throwable class except RuntimeException and Error are known as checked
                 exceptions. For example, IOException, SQLException, etc. Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time.

Unchecked Exception
                   The classes that inherit the RuntimeException are known as unchecked exceptions. For example, ArithmeticException,
                   NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, etc. Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time,
                    but they are checked at runtime


 try
 Nested try block
                  Java Nested try block
                  In Java, using a try block inside another try block is permitted. It is called as nested try block.
                  Every statement that we enter a statement in try block, context of that exception is pushed onto the stack.
 catch
       A try block can be followed by one or more catch blocks.Each catch block must contain a different exception handler. So,
       if you have to perform different tasks at the occurrence of different exceptions, use java multi-catch block.
       At a time only one exception occurs and at a time only one catch block is executed.
       All catch blocks must be ordered from most specific to most general, i.e. catch for ArithmeticException must come before catch for Exception.
