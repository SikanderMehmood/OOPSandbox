Serialization : is a mechanism of converting state of an object into byte stream.
DeSerialization is the reverse process of converting the byte stream into the actual objects in the memory!


Byte stream created is platform independent.
To make a java object serializable we make a java.io.serializable interface.

The ObjectOutPutStream class contains writeObject()   method to serializable Object.

The ObjectInputStream class contains readObject() method for deserializable an Object.

Only non static members can be saved via Serialization process!



Advantages:
          To travel and object across the network!
          store in the files.

          ------------------

          A java object is serializable if its class of any super calss implements Serializable interface.

          to prevent one data member to be not serialized you can use 'transient' keyword;
           transient int x = 4;
