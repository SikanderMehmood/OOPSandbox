      1)  AOP ->Aspect oriented programming
      2)  Inversion of Control
      3) Dependency Injection





      1) AOP
      specify method interceptors and pointcuts
      To execute something before and after the execution of the method
      @Around
      @Before
      @After

      Dependency Injection
      It is mainly for loose Coupling.
     You have two classes , Laptop and HardDrive
     Laptop needs HardDrive Object so instead of tightCoupling(making an instance of hardDrive in the Laptop class) , you just inject that dependency.
     You create and register bean of HardDrive object with @Component and then use this bean in Laptop Class with annotation @AutoWire

     @AutoWire
     HardDrive drive;

     This also helps in unit testing , if your Laptop class is loosely coupled , you can mock this HardDrive class and to unit testing.


     --------------------------
     Java beans is an example of encapsulation.
