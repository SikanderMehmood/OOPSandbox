Array is fixed size homogeneous data structure used for storing elements of same data type
Generics are not supported in Array
In Array values are stored at contiguous  locations.



While ArrayList is dynamic size , provides more flexibility and builtin methods.

Primitives can be stored directly in array but wrapper classes are used when storing in arrayList
Generics are supported in ArrayList.
In ArrayList values are not stored at contiguous locations however reference to those ArrayList objects are stored at contiguous locations.

ArrayList objects are stored in the heap memory , however it internally used an array to store the references for those objects.

When elements are added in the arrayList and list reaches its capacity , the ArrayList creates a new array typically 50% larger than the old array size.


In ArrayList , Elements are accessed using their index similar to how they are accessed in traditional array.
This allows for constant  retrieval time. O(1)

    When an element is added , it will be added at the next possible index.
    When removed whole arrayList needs to be adjusted to fill the gap -> This can be expensive as of O(n)
