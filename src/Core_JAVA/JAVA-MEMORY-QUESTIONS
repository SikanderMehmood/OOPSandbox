Memory Leak

Unused objects that are still being referenced are the cause of memory leaks.

Memory leaks through static fields -> static fields have a lifespan of program itself , hance when GC() they are not removed.

When you open a stream/database connection / session  and forget to close them , they stay in memory and are being references , even though they are not being used anymore.


Avoid finalize methods

objects of class with finalize methods are not instantly garbage collected instead they are kept for finalization which occurs at a later point in time.
