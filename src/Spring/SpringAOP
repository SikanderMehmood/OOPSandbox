Basic unit of modularization in AOP is Aspect.
AOP models an aspect of an application i.e Logging , transaction

These aspects are cut across multiple types and objects known as cross cutting concerns.


Aspect :
       An aspect is modularization of concerns that cut across multiple classes.
       For example Logging
       In Spring aspects can be managed through regular classes and @Aspect annotation/Xml configuration.


JoinPoint :
        A join point is a point during the execution of a program i.e the execution of another method or handling an exception.
        in Spring join points are always method execution.


Advice-The Action

        An Advice is an action taken at a specific join point.
        Advices are plain java methods with one of the Advice annotations.
        Advices in Spring are
        @Before
        @After
        @After returning
        @After Throwing
        @Around

        Spring framework models an advice and maintains a chain of interceptors around the join point.
