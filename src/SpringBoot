Dependency Injection

Constructor injection are Mandatory injections , setter injections are not mandatory injections

You can do setter injection like this

@AutoWire(required=false)
public void setAnimal(@Quilifier("dog") Animal animal){

this.animal=animal;
}

 it will not give a compile time error
 but when you try to access the bean that you did not create (with annotation @component) , it will give null pointer exception

public class AutoWiredController{


 @Autowire(required=false)
 public AutoWiredController(@Qualifier("dog") Animal animal){
   this.animal=animal;
 }

}


Spring Boot @SpringBootApplication annotation is used to mark a configuration class that declares
one or more @Bean methods and also triggers auto-configuration and component scanning.
 It's same as declaring a class with

 @Configuration,
 @EnableAutoConfiguration
 @ComponentScan
