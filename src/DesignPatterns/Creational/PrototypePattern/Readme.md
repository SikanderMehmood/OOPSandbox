Cloning of an existing object instead of creating of new one.

This pattern should be followed if the cost of creating cost is expensive and resource intensive.


Advantages:  It will let you add and remove objects at runtime.
             it hides complexities in creating objects.
             The client can get new object and does not need to know what type of object.
             it reduces the need of subclassing.
