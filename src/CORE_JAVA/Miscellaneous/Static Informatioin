Static Block :
              This block is executed when class is loaded into the memory and execute before main method.
              That means  you can run your java program without main method with the help of static block.

              exclusion of main method is only till java 6 , after that version you have to have main method.

              Why main method is static
                 Main method is static so compiler can call it without  creating object of the class.





              Parent class methods that are static are not part of a child class (although they are accessible),
              so there is no question of overriding it. Even if you add another static method in a subclass,
              identical to the one in its parent class, this subclass static method is unique and distinct
              from the static method in its parent class.


              Because if we are declaring any method with the final keyword, we are
              indicating the JVM to provide some special attention and make sure no one can override it.
              As you know by use of the overriding concept, we can provide the different implementation in child classes.
              But sometimes we want to provide only default
              implementation to each child class. We can prevent the overriding of the method by use of the final keyword.

              We cannot have same class variable in a class , we will get a stackOverflow error
              you can if you declare it static

           public class Test{

           Test(){
                System.out.println("");
           }
             static Test t = new Test();

             public static void main(){
              Test test =new Test();

             }

           }
