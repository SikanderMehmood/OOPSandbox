Arrays

-> Collection of objects for the same data type
-> Size cannot be changed after allocation as items are changed contigously

If you need to store elements that will not change size , array is the way to go because it has little overhead.
Takes longer to search.
Must copy all items to a new list if items are more than the size allocated.
We have to shift elements for insertion and deletion.


--------Array takes less memory but time consuming.
-------------------------------------------------

LinkedList takes more memory and is more time Consuming as well.
Very quick at inserting and deleting



HASH-MAP

HashMap<String,int> map = new HashMap();

map.put("ONE",1);
map.put("key",2);

map.remove(key);

System.out.println(map.values()); ->print all values in the map
System.out.println(map.keySet()); ->print all keys in the map


Searching/Insertion/Deletion is much faster with HashMap(), but it takes up more memory.

1) Difference between List and set?

List can have duplicate elements.
Set always have unique elements.


List work on index base.
set work on hash.

When we need to frequently access the elements based on index.
Set when you want to design a collection of distant elements.
